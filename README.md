# Clustering-Grocery-Items
This is a project I've worked on that contains an optimal algorithm to create clusters of grocery items that are most likely to be bought together. The accuracy of the clusters predicted by the chosen algorithm was 96.28%.

### Abstract.docx
It contains details about the requirements of the project, the proposed modifications to the existing system, and the Hardware requirements.

### Datasets

This file contains mapping of the name of the grocery item to its assigned item id number.

#### purchase_history.csv
This file contains a raw representation of user purchase history. 

#### prepared_purchased_history.csv
This file contains a clean representation of the user purchase history.

### Documentation.pdf
